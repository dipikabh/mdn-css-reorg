This repository tracks the proposal for reorganizing [CSS docs on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS).

## Folder structure (as JSON)

- Current CSS structure on MDN: [css-tree.json](https://github.com/dipikabh/mdn-css-reorg/blob/main/css-tree-proposed.json)
- Proposed CSS structure: [css-tree-proposed.json](https://github.com/dipikabh/mdn-css-reorg/blob/main/css-tree-proposed.json)


To view the folder structure as a JSON tree:
1. Download the `css-tree.json` and `css-tree-proposed.json` files.
2. To view them:
    - Open them in Firefox.
    - **_OR_** use [JSON Crack](https://jsoncrack.com/editor): File > Import, then View > Tree.

## Visual preview

This is a snapshot of the proposed structure (from JSONcrack):
